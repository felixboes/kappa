1) Download gmp 6.0.0 (or whatever version you prefere) e.g.
     wget https://gmplib.org/download/gmp/gmp-6.0.0a.tar.bz2

2) Unpack the library somewhere. If you downloaded the *.lz version you might want to install lzip first.
     tar -xf gmp-6.0.0a.tar.bz2
     cd gmp-6.0.0a.tar.bz2

3) Configure the library. You want c++ support. Inorder to use it only for the kappa project, install it into the kappa directory.
   If a package is missing (like m4 on some ubuntu versions) you have to install them (e.g. on some ubuntu versions: sudo apt-get install m4)
     ./configure --enable-cxx --prefix=/path/to/kappa

4) Build the library
     make

5) Test the library
     make check

6) Optimize the library
     cd tune
     make tune
     cd ../

7) Install the library
     make install

8) Moreover install tcmalloc (as super user).  The following lines depend on your linux distro. I have debian 7.
     apt-get install libgoogle-perftools-dev

9) compile the kappa project with advanced optimization options.
     cd /path/to/kappa
     make clean
     make ADV_OPTIMIZATION=1 compute_...
